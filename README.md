# Attack on Titan : Utopia

  Attack on Titans group project using javafx

## **Overview**

**Attack on Titan: Utopia** is a one-player, endless tower defense game inspired by the *Attack on Titan* anime. Players defend the Utopia District against waves of titans using various anti-titan weapons. The battlefield is divided into multiple lanes, each with a wall segment to protect. Titans advance each turn, attacking the walls when they reach them. Players deploy weapons strategically to defeat titans and earn resources. The game continues until all lanes are lost, with increasing difficulty over time through different battle phases.

The goal is to survive as long as possible, managing resources and upgrading defenses to fend off the ever-growing titan threat. The game continues endlessly until all lanes are lost, challenging players to achieve high scores and improve their defense strategies with each playthrough.
